# Portfolio2.0lio
Challenge 20 - An updated and refactored personal portfolio leveraging React.js

## Description
Nearing the end of our course, our cohort was tasked with revamping one of our earliest projects: our own project portfolio. The objective was to implement a top-to-bottom reimagination of our intial project page- this time by employing JavaScript and React.js to create a single-page portfolio that is responsive, data-driven, and polished.
